# Pay Attention to your Audience

As storytellers, your role is to make the audience suspend their disbelief and trust in your characters, world and story.

The audience
- Wants to feel included in the story
- Enjoy the tension/conflict in the story and looks forward to the resolution
- Wants to learn or take away something from the story

To do this, the story's world, characters, events and even the conflict has to be relatable to the audience.

# Immersion and Extractability (Jenkins, H. 2009).
## Immersion 
The audience needs to be immersed in the story world for them to become invested in the story.

This is achieved through character building, world building and the plot, factors that you can control. The richness and accuracy of the details will make the story more realistic and tangible to the audience. 

The challenges that the characters face has to resonate with the audience.

## Extractability 
When the audience gets invested in a story, deep down they want to be able to take something away from the story. This could be something tangible or intangible, a part of the story that they will remember for a long time. A good story's core challenge can become learning points for the audiences - when the story's main character goes through catharsis and resolution, a good story will also enable the audience to feel the same way. 

You have to craft stories that are relatable to your audience, stories that engages them, where the audience can see a part of themselves in your story from their own perspective or lived experiences.
