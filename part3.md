# Creating your own story

There are many techniques that you can use to get started with crafting a great story. Here are some ways that I find useful:

## 1. Rapid Brainstorming

Step 1. Think of the main message that you want the audience to take away from your story
Step 2: Identify the main story core (i.e. the main conflict(s) or challenge(s))
Step 3: Identify the characters you need
Step 4: Identify the world
Step 5: Identify the events and potential actions

With the exception of Step 1, the brainstorming process should be done very quickly. Write down the things or ideas that come to your mind.

## 2. Outlines

An outline here will refer to a a succinct and organised list of the characters, story world and events. 

Look at the ideas that you have come up with after the brainstorming session. Can you link any of them up to form the plot of the story? 

You can do this either in a list, or in a table, or a detailed timemap. 

With the outline, you can start to arrange how your story will be told and organise the sequence of events/actions that will take place in your story.

## 3. Storyboarding or sketching

If you are recording videos, you can draw a detailed storyboard based on your outline. The storyboard should include sketches of the scene, characters, how you would compose the shot, and what the characters will do.

If you are designing a website, you can start with a sketch of the website. This wire framing exercise will allow you to organise the components of your website, designing what is the user interface your audience will see.
