#### Other considerations about Digital Storytelling

There are often questions about distribution, accessibility, usability and copyright/permissions when content is put online.

Distribution: 
- Is the content going to be printed? Or only digital copies? Will it be behind paid access? Advertisements?

Accessibility: 
- Who can access? Can they afford? Do they have digital devices and internet access to view your website? Colour blindness? Browser compatibility issues? 

Usability: 
- How can your audience use your website content? Can they take a photo of it and publish it in their website? 

Copyright/permissions: 
- Who owns the images/materials? Do you have permission? How to cite? What are the terms of use?
